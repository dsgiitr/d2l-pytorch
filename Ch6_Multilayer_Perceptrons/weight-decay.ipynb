    "1. We know that $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2 = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{w}$. Can you find a similar equation for matrices (mathematicians call this the [Frobenius norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm))?\n",
    "1. Review the relationship between training error and generalization error. In addition to weight decay, increased training, and the use of a model of suitable complexity, what other ways can you think of to deal with overfitting?\n",
    "1. In Bayesian statistics we use the product of prior and likelihood to arrive at a posterior via $p(w|x) \\propto p(x|w) p(w)$. How can you identify $p(w)$ with regularization?\n"
