    "One-hot encoding vectors provide an easy way to express words as vectors in order to process them in a deep network. In a nutshell, we map each word to a different unit vector: assume that the number of different characters in the dictionary is $N$ (the `len(vocab)`) and each character has a one-to-one correspondence with a single value in the index of successive integers from 0 to $N-1$. If the index of a character is the integer $i$, then we create a vector $\\mathbf{e}_i$ of all 0s with a length of $N$ and set the element at position $i$ to 1. This vector is the one-hot vector of the original character. The one-hot vectors with indices 0 and 2 are shown below (the length of the vector is equal to the dictionary size)."

It also has the desirable side-effect of limiting the influence any given minibatch (and within it any given sample) can exert on the weight vectors. This bestows a certain degree of robustness to the model. Back to the case at hand - optimization in RNNs. One of the issues is that the gradients in an RNN may either explode or vanish. Consider the chain of matrix-products involved in backpropagation. If the largest eigenvalue of the matrices is typically larger than $1$, then the product of many such matrices can be much larger than $1$. As a result, the aggregate gradient might explode. Gradient clipping provides a quick fix. While it doesn't entire solve the problem, it is one of the many techniques to alleviate it."

    "\n",
    "* Sequence models need state initialization for training.\n",
    "* Between sequential models you need to ensure to detach the gradient, to ensure that the automatic differentiation does not propagate effects beyond the current sample.\n",
    "* A simple RNN language model consists of an encoder, an RNN model and a decoder.\n",
    "* Gradient clipping prevents gradient explosion (but it cannot fix vanishing gradients).\n",
    "* Perplexity calibrates model performance across variable sequence length. It is the exponentiated average of the cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "* Sequential partitioning typically leads to better models.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Show that one-hot encoding is equivalent to picking a different embedding for each object.\n",
    "1. Adjust the hyperparameters to improve the perplexity.\n",
    "    * How low can you go? Adjust embeddings, hidden units, learning rate, etc.\n",
    "    * How well will it work on other books by H. G. Wells, e.g. [The War of the Worlds](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36).\n",
    "1. Run the code in this section without clipping the gradient. What happens?\n",
    "1. Set the `pred_period` variable to 1 to observe how the under-trained model (high perplexity) writes lyrics. What can you learn from this?\n",
    "1. Change adjacent sampling so that it does not separate hidden states from the computational graph. Does the running time change? How about the accuracy?\n",
    "1. Replace the activation function used in this section with ReLU and repeat the experiments in this section.\n",
    "1. Prove that the perplexity is the inverse of the harmonic mean of the conditional word probabilities.\n"
