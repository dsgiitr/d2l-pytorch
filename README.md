# d2l-pytorch
This project is inspired of the original [Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai) book by Aston Zhang, Zack C. Lipton, Mu Li, Alex J. Smola 
and all the community contributors. We have made an effort to modify the book and convert the MXnet code snippets into PyTorch.

## Contributing

  * Please feel free to open a Pull Request to contribute a notebook in PyTorch for the rest of the chapters.

  * Also, if you think there's any section that requires more/better explanation, please use the issue tracker to 
    open an issue and let us know about the same. We'll get back as soon as possible.

  * Find some code that needs improvement and submit a pull request.

  * Find a reference that we missed and submit a pull request.

  * Try not to submit huge pull requests since this makes them hard to understand and incorporate. 
    Better send several smaller ones.
