    "\n",
    " • Padding can increase the height and width of the output. This is often used to give the output the same height and width as the input.\n",
    " \n",
    " • The stride can reduce the resolution of the output, for example reducing the height and width of the output to only 1/n of the height and width of the input (n is an integer greater than 1).\n",
    " \n",
    " • Padding and stride can be used to adjust the dimensionality of the data effectively.\n",

    " 1. or the last example in this section, use the shape calculation formula to calculate the output shape to see if it is consistent with the experimental results.\n",
