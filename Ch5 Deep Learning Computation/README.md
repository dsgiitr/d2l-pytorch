 In this chapter we will cover various key components of deep learning
computation, such as model construction, parameter access and initialization, custom layers, and reading,
storing, and using GPUs. Throughout this chapter, you will gain important insights into model implementation and computation details, which gives readers a solid foundation for implementing more complex
models in the following chapters.
